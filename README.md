Smart Payment option for non Smartphone users


Most of us use their smartphone every day, to surf the internet and social media platforms, check emails, manage calendars, listen to music, play games, watch videos, take photos, read the news, write text messages and also, every now and then we use them for their original purpose, to make phone calls. Now all these activities can be done using one single device. And after the demonetization Payment Digitalization is one of the growing area in IT industry.

But in India we still have many people who doesnâ€™t use the smart phone, or there are some places where internet facility is not available, so our idea is to provide the solution for those people so that they can also take benefit of Digitalization in the Payment sector.
